\begin{conclusion}

This work has provided an extensive overview of topics employed in \gls{cv} applications today.
Based on that some popular methods were implemented from scratch or taken over from open-source repositories and customized to meet the thesis assignment.

The proposed methods are designed in several variations to meet different trade-offs of accuracy versus computational complexity. and since the final design of the framework is fully modular, it can be easily configured to meet demands for various other scenarios. Quite a lot of work has been done regarding design of the framework as a whole so that it can be easily expanded and it can now be deployed in real-world applications.

There are still problems that have not yet been addressed, especially with regards to 

To conclude, this thesis has provided 
and we hope that this work will be a useful as a staring point for other people interested in this topic. The result is a functioning people tracking and soft-biometrics extracting framework.
